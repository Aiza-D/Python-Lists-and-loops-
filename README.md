# Lists and loops in Python
Basic Lists and Loops Methods in Python Language. 
# What are Lists?
A list is a data structure in Python that is a mutable, or changeable, ordered sequence of elements. Each element or value that is inside of a list is called an item. Just as strings are defined as characters between quotes, lists are defined by having values between square brackets      [ ].
# What are Loops?
Looping means repeating something over and over until a particular condition is satisfied.
# Type of Loops
There are mainly two types of loops. Letâ€™s discuss them one by one.


## 1. For Loop
A for loop in Python is used to iterate over a sequence (list, tuple, set, dictionary, and string).

## Syntax: 

  for iterating_var in sequence:  

   statement(s) 

## Example:

Fig: for loop example

The preceding code executes as follows: The variable i is a placeholder for every item in your iterable object. The loop iterates as many times as the number of elements and prints the elements serially.


## 2. While Loop
The while loop is used to execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.

## Syntax: 

   while expression:  

    statements  

## Example:

The preceding code executes as follows: We assign the value to variable x as 1. Until the value of x is less than 3, the loop continues and prints the numbers.
